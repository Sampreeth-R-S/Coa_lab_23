TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -2.054 ns between x_temp_reg[3]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and y_reg[8]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>
